### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at the University of British Columbia interested in programming language theory, compilers, and developer tooling. Currently, I am experimenting with [doom emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) and [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), as well as functional programming languages.
